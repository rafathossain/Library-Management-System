## Library Management System API
Create a simple API for a Library Management System using Django. The API should allow
users to manage books, authors, and borrowing transactions.
### Requirements:
1. Implement API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books and
authors.
2. Each book should have a title, author, publication date, and availability status.
3. Each author should have a name and a list of associated books.
4. Implement an API endpoint to create borrowing transactions, including the book,
borrower's information, and due date.
5. Implement proper validation and error handling in the API.
6. Write unit tests to ensure the API functions correctly.
### Guidelines:
1. Use Django and Django REST Framework to build the API.
2. Create appropriate database models for books, authors, and borrowing transactions.
3. Implement the necessary API views, serializers, and URL patterns to handle the
required operations.
4. Apply appropriate status codes and data formats (JSON) for the API responses.


Please provide the solution as a complete Django project, including the necessary project
structure, database models, API views, serializers, tests, and any additional files required
